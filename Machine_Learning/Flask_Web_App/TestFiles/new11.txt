Personally, I found the EDA section quite poor. The plot the author provided isn't formatted correctly, i.e. part of it is off the page and isn't displayed properly and there was practically no commentary on what the plot actually displayed. Additionally, the plot of numerical predictors weren't provided. I know that it is boring doing EDA when the exciting Bayesian Modeling section is next but it's easy points which you could lose if you rush it. It is also incorrect to say that variables such as drama are unlikely to impact predictions. From what I can see from the box plot for drama is that if a movie is a drama, the movie has on average 5-6 points higher score than non-drama movies. At this point in time, we do not know if this is significant or not. If I didn't have any other information to go on, drama alone would give me some information about the predicted rating. Additionally, in the modeling section, the heatmap wasn't explained. What does that plot show? Also, it was not explained why BIC was used. Would the author have still used BIC if there were 100 predictors (hint: do we need to use MCMC)? Why were some of the predictors omitted? Where's the residual plot? If the author had plotted the residuals, they may have found that the residuals systematically underestimate and overestimate some regions indicating that another model should be investigated leading to some discussions about improvement in the conclusion. Finally, don't be disheartened with this review of your work, it just needed a little more time to get a perfect score which you could have done.
